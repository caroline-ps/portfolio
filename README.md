My name is Caroline Silva and I am a UX designer in Oslo, Norway. 
I have a deep interest and passion for arts, design and technology, because I believe they can help improve people's lives.
In future I would like to continue my education and learn even more about design and front-end.
I love working on meaningful projects that accomplish practical goals and offer good solutions to real problems. 
I always look forward to learning more, get to know new people and jump into new interesting opportunities.

Here you can find an overview of my most relevant projects within UX design and Front-end.

** UX Design

profession of making a real difference in people's lives. I have always being interested in people, technology and arts. 
UX design encompasses all my three biggest interests while at the same time offering meaningful working-goals.
