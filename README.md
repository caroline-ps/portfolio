# My Portfolio

![me](/Images/me.jpg)

My name is Caroline Silva and I am a UX designer in Oslo, Norway. 
I have a deep interest and passion for arts, design and technology, because I believe they can help improve people's lives.
In future I would like to continue my education and learn even more about design and front-end.
I love working on meaningful projects that accomplish practical goals and offer good solutions to real problems. 
I always look forward to learning more, get to know new people and jump into new interesting opportunities.

<b>My passion for UX Design and Front-End</b>

We all seek a meaningful life. I became appasionate in UX Design after I realized how many possibilieties there are in this
profession of making a real difference in people's lives. I have always being interested in people, technology and arts. 
UX design encompasses all my three biggest interests while at the same time offering meaningful working-goals.

Front-End is interesting for me for two reasons. 
The first one is that it helps me work better as a designer, as I am able to understand how technically feasible some of my
ideas are, how hard it would be to realize them, how much time it would require, etc. This helps in having a better communication
with developers. 
The second reason I like front-end is because it offers me the satisfaction of working on a project and being able to understand it 
and realize it in almost its entirety from start to end. 

I have taken a one-year UX Design course at the University of Noroff in Oslo, and I always look forward on continuing my education
and learning new, exciting ways to become better in my profession and therefore offer more value in my work.

Here is an overview of my most relevant design and front-end projects.
