## Research & Insights

In UX Design the main focus is on how to improve people's lives by offering better solutions to real-life problems. Therefore, the most important step in the UX Design process is to understand the user and what his root-problem is.

Albert Einstein said it best "If I had an hour to solve a problem Iâ€™d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions." Solutions can always be worked and improved upon, but there is obviously no use for a solution of a non-existing problem.

Here is a case study I did at the beginning of my UX Design course that primarily focused on this first design process step.

## Ideation & Planning

To offer the highest possible value in the work we do as designers we need to strive to find original, better solutions than those already existent.
If a problem is relevant enough, it is highly probable that someone has already tried to come up with a solution to solve it. As designers, we can take inspiration
from the existing ideas, but we need to find ways to improve upon them and not just offer another equally-worthy alternative.

Good ideas are the product of a mix of different assets such as creativity, knowleadge, inspiration and method. 

In the case study below I worked on solving the problem of loneliness among young people in Norway by defining what the main issue was and trying to ideate possible solutions.
