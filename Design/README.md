## Research & Insights

In UX Design the main focus is on how to improve people's lives by offering better solutions to real-life problems. Therefore, the most important step in the UX Design process is to understand the user and what his root-problem is.

Albert Einstein said it best "If I had an hour to solve a problem Iâ€™d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and five minutes thinking about solutions." Solutions can always be worked and improved upon, but there is obviously no use for a solution of a non-existing problem.

Here is a case study I did at the beginning of my UX Design course that primarily focused on this first design process step.
